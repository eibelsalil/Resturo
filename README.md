   1-i add new folder called the adminPanel inside you will find panelTest.js file
    it's about the panel that the admin can access it after singed in 
   2-i add config folder inside you will find the config.js that contain all the firebase config object 
   3-i add props for input-form.js for that the input can accept value 
   4-i add state for email and password input in the singinCont component using React hooks 
   5-i add two methods (changeEmail,changePassword) in the singinCont component to manage the state of the two inputs
   6-i add login method in the singinCont component to mmanage firebase login method
   7-i add logout button and method for the Panel component for managing the firebase logout method
    conclusion => the fire auth developed succesfully you only need new email and password after we finish developing the admin side i used a test email and password
